## Important Notes

### Before Importing

1. **Review the preset** - Open the `.json` file to see what packages will be removed
2. **Reference package-reference.md** - Understand what each package does
3. **Start with conservative** - You can always remove more later
4. **Backup important data** - Just in case

### After Importing

1. **Review selections in Canta** - Make sure nothing critical is selected
2. **Uncheck packages you want to keep** - Canta allows deselecting
3. **Confirm removal** - Double-check before confirming
4. **Reboot device** - After debloating, restart your phone

### If Something Breaks

See `RESTORE-GUIDE.md` for restoration procedures.

Quick restore command:
```
adb shell cmd package install-existing PACKAGE_NAME
```

Or factory reset to restore everything.

## Creating Custom Presets

You can create your own JSON preset:

1. Create a new `.json` file
2. Use this template:
```json
{
  "name": "My Custom Preset",
  "description": "Description of what this removes",
  "version": "1.0",
  "packages": [
    "com.facebook.katana",
    "com.samsung.android.tvplus",
    "com.google.android.apps.youtube.music"
  ]
}
```
3. Save and import to Canta

Reference the main debloat scripts (`01-safe-user-apps.txt`, etc.) for package names.

## Troubleshooting

### "Package not found" errors
Normal - means the package doesn't exist on your device (e.g., wrong carrier)

### Can't find Import Preset option
Make sure you have Canta v3.0.0 or later (preset import was added in v3.0.0). Update from Play Store or F-Droid if needed.

### Preset won't import
- Check the JSON file format is valid
- Try opening the preset file in a text editor to verify it's not corrupted
- Make sure file has .json extension
