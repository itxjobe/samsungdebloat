# Performance Testing Guide

How to measure the actual impact of debloating on your Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge.

## Before You Start

Document baseline performance BEFORE debloating for accurate comparison.

---

## Battery Life Testing

### Method 1: Built-in Battery Stats

**Before Debloat:**
1. Fully charge phone to 100%
2. Use normally for 24 hours
3. Settings > Battery > Battery usage
4. Note percentage remaining after 24h
5. Screenshot the battery graph

**After Debloat:**
1. Fully charge to 100%
2. Use phone similarly for 24 hours
3. Compare results

**What to note:**
- Screen-on time
- Apps using battery
- Background usage
- Percentage left after 24h

### Method 2: AccuBattery App

1. Install AccuBattery from Play Store
2. Use for 3-7 days to establish baseline
3. Debloat phone
4. Use for another 3-7 days
5. Compare battery drain rates

**Metrics:**
- mAh/hour drain
- Screen-on time
- Deep sleep percentage

## RAM Usage Testing

### Check RAM Before/After

**Method:**
1. Settings > Device care > Memory
2. Note "Used" and "Available"
3. Reboot phone
4. Wait 5 minutes
5. Check again

**Before Debloat Example:**
```
Used: 4.2 GB
Available: 3.8 GB
```

**After Debloat Example:**
```
Used: 3.5 GB
Available: 4.5 GB
```

**Improvement: ~700MB freed**

### Developer Options Method

1. Enable Developer options
2. Developer options > Running services
3. Count services running
4. Note RAM used

---

## Storage Space

### Check Storage

**Before & After:**
1. Settings > Storage
2. Note "Used" and "Available"

**Note:** ADB uninstall doesn't free much storage (only app data, not APK files).

**Expected:** 100-500MB freed

---

## App Launch Speed

### Manual Testing

Test commonly used apps:

**Before Debloat:**
1. Clear recent apps
2. Tap app icon, start timer
3. Note time until fully loaded
4. Repeat 3 times, average

**After Debloat:**
- Repeat same test
- Compare average times

**Apps to test:**
- Camera
- Phone
- Messages
- Browser
- Your most-used apps

### Developer Options

1. Developer options > Profile GPU rendering
2. Enable "On screen as bars"
3. Open various apps
4. Green line should be below threshold

---

## System Responsiveness

### Subjective Tests

Rate 1-10 before and after:

- App opening speed
- UI smoothness
- Keyboard responsiveness
- Switching between apps
- Overall "snappiness"

### Objective: Dropped Frames

1. Developer options > Profile GPU rendering
2. Use phone normally
3. Count bars above green line (dropped frames)
4. Fewer = better

---

## Boot Time

### Test Cold Boot

**Before:**
1. Power off completely
2. Start timer when pressing power
3. Stop when lock screen appears
4. Repeat 3 times, average

**After:**
- Same process
- Compare times

**Expected:** 1-3 seconds faster

---

## Thermal Performance

### Temperature Monitoring

**Apps:**
- CPU Monitor
- AIDA64

**Test:**
1. Use phone heavily for 10 minutes (gaming, video)
2. Note max temperature
3. Compare before/after debloat

**Expected:** Slightly lower temps (fewer background services)

---

## Network Performance

### Not Affected by Debloat

**Note:** Debloating doesn't improve:
- WiFi speed
- Mobile data speed
- Signal strength

Unless you removed network-optimizing apps (rare).

---

## Camera Performance

### Check Camera Speed

**Test:**
1. Open Camera app
2. Time until ready to shoot
3. Take photo, note processing time
4. Switch modes, note lag

**Should not change** unless you removed camera packages.

---

## Benchmark Apps

### AnTuTu Benchmark

1. Install from Play Store
2. Run full test BEFORE debloat
3. Note overall score
4. Debloat
5. Run again AFTER debloat
6. Compare

**Expected:** Minimal change (debloat affects background, not CPU/GPU performance)

### Geekbench

Similar process:
- CPU test
- GPU test
- Compare before/after

---

## Real-World Usage Testing

### 7-Day Comparison

**Before Debloat - Week 1:**
- Document daily usage patterns
- Note any lag or issues
- Battery percentage at end of day
- Apps that cause problems

**After Debloat - Week 2:**
- Use phone identically
- Same apps, same usage
- Compare experiences

---

## What Improvements to Expect

### Realistic Expectations

**Battery Life:**
- Conservative: 5-10% improvement
- Moderate: 10-20% improvement
- Aggressive: 15-25% improvement

**RAM:**
- 200-800MB freed
- Faster multitasking
- Apps stay in memory longer

**Storage:**
- 100-500MB freed (limited)
- Main benefit is RAM, not storage

**Speed:**
- Slightly faster app launching
- Less UI lag
- Faster boot time
- Smoother animations

**What won't improve:**
- CPU/GPU performance (same hardware)
- Network speeds
- Camera quality
- Display quality
