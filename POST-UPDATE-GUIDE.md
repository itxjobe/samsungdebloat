# Post-Update Guide

What to do after OneUI software updates to maintain your debloated setup.

## After Major Updates (OneUI 8.0 â†’ 8.1, etc.)

### Step 1: Check for New Bloatware

```bash
# List all installed packages
adb shell pm list packages > packages-after-update.txt

# Compare with previous list (if you saved it)
diff packages-before-update.txt packages-after-update.txt
```

### Step 2: Review Removed Packages

Good news: **Removed packages stay removed** after updates.

Updates won't restore apps you removed, but may add new bloatware.

### Step 3: Look for New Packages

Search for common bloatware patterns:
```bash
adb shell pm list packages | grep -i facebook
adb shell pm list packages | grep -i game
adb shell pm list packages | grep -i tvplus
```

### Step 4: Remove New Bloatware

If new bloatware appeared:
1. Identify package name
2. Check if it's in our scripts
3. Remove using ADB
4. Update your documentation

## After Minor Updates (Security Patches)

Usually safe - minor updates rarely add apps.

**Quick check:**
```bash
adb shell pm list packages | wc -l
```

Compare count with previous. Significant increase = new apps.

## Testing After Update

### Critical Features Checklist

After any update, test:

- [ ] Phone calls

## Recommended Workflow

### Before Update

```bash
# Save current package list
adb shell pm list packages > pre-update-packages.txt

# Note what you removed (if you didn't track it)
# Compare with a stock S25 Edge list
```

### After Update

```bash
# Save new package list
adb shell pm list packages > post-update-packages.txt

# Find new packages
comm -13 pre-update-packages.txt post-update-packages.txt
```

### Remove New Bloatware

Run appropriate scripts again, or remove individual packages.
